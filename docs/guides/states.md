# States

A state is an abstract representation of a system (such as an application) at a specific point in time. As an application is interacted with, events cause it to change state.

## Configuration

In `xstate`, a _state node_ specifies a state configuration, and are defined on the machine's `states` property. Substate nodes are recursively defined in the same way.

The state determined from `machine.transition(state, event)` represents a combination of state nodes. For example, in the machine below, there's a `success` state node and an `items` substate node. The state value `{ success: 'items' }` represents the combination of those state nodes.

```js
const fetchMachine = Machine({
  id: 'fetch',

  // Initial state
  initial: 'idle',

  // States
  states: {
    idle: {
      on: {
        FETCH: 'pending'
      }
    },
    pending: {
      on: {
        FULFILL: 'success',
        REJECT: 'failure'
      }
    },
    success: {
      // Initial substate
      initial: 'allItems',
      
      // Substates
      states: {
        items: {
          on: {
            'ITEM.CLICK': 'item'
          }
        },
        item: {
          on: {
            BACK: 'items'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## State node types
(since 4.0.0)

There are five different kinds of state nodes:

- An **atomic** state node has no child states. (I.e., it is a leaf node.)
- A **compound** state node contains one or more child `states`, and has an `initial` state, which is the key of one of those child states.
- A **parallel** state node contains two or more child `states`, and has no initial state, since it represents being in all of its child states at the same time.
- A **final** state node is a leaf node that represents an abstract "terminal" state.
- A **history** state node is an abstract node that represents resolving to its parent node's most recent shallow or deep history state.

The state node type can be explicitly defined on the state node:

```js
const machine = Machine({
  id: 'fetch'
  initial: 'idle',
  states: {
    idle: {
      type: 'atomic',
      on: {
        FETCH: 'pending'
      }
    },
    pending: {
      type: 'parallel',
      states: {
        resource1: {
          type: 'compound',
          initial: 'pending',
          states: {
            pending: {
              on: {
                'FULFILL.resource1': 'success'
              }
            },
            success: {
              type: 'final'
            }
          }
        },
        resource2: {
          type: 'compound',
          initial: 'pending',
          states: {
            pending: {
              on: {
                'FULFILL.resource2': 'success'
              }
            },
            success: {
              type: 'final'
            }
          }
        }
      },
      on: {
        'done.state.fetch.pending': 'success'
      }
    },
    success: {
      type: 'compound',
      initial: 'allItems',
      states: {
        items: {
          on: {
            'ITEM.CLICK': 'item'
          }
        },
        item: {
          on: {
            BACK: 'items'
          }
        },
        hist: {
          type: 'history',
          history: 'shallow'
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```
