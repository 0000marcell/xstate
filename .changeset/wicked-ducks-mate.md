'xstate': patch
---

XState will now warn if you define an `.onDone` transition on the root node. Root nodes which are "done" represent the machine being in its final state, and can no longer accept any events. This has been reported as confusing in [#1111](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/issues/1111).
