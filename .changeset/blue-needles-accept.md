The types for the `send()` and `sendParent()` action creators have been changed to fix the issue of only being able to send events that the machine can receive. In reality, a machine can and should send events to other actors that it might not be able to receive itself. See [#711](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/issues/711) for more information.
